Code notes 

first we start with the runner class, which creates the new IMS 

Then we have the  IMS class.

we take in all the DATA access objects and controllers to help with the database integration 
We then have the do while loop that gets what the user wants, being item order or customer. 

Which is then called from the Domain.java It will take the user input from the command line and change it to uppercase, with validation if an incorrect choice is made

We have the domain enum as well so it keeps the choices as predefined constants

We have our welcome message and a prompt asking what choice you'd like and then asks what youd like to do with it

When a user makes a selection it will call the corresponding choice's controller 

theres an array list of items here so we can alter the tables. and a  while loop to keep asking customers for choices until they wish to stop

the item, customer and order classes contain all the data to be used in the controllers and the Data Access Objectss

Ideally, if this week went a little better i would connect it up to the relational database ive got so it can populate tables and pull from them to list customers, items and whatnot



SQL

I know its not much but i did a little bit of sql to go along with it
